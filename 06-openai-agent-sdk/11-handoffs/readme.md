# **Handoffs**:

**Handoffs** in the OpenAI Agents SDK are a core primitive for breaking complex workflows into clear, maintainable steps by transferring control—and the shared conversational context—from one agent to another. Rather than building one monolithic agent that tries to do everything, you define multiple smaller agents, each specialized for a particular task, and use handoffs to “pass the baton” between them. Here’s everything you need to know about handoffs:



## **1. Definition**

A **handoff** is a directive in your agent workflow that tells the SDK:

> “After this agent finishes its part, switch control to another agent named ‘X’ for the next phase.”

In code, it’s represented by the `Handoff(to="AgentName")` object placed between agents in a chain or list.



## **2. Why Use Handoffs?**

* **Modularity**: Encapsulate distinct responsibilities (analysis, summarization, translation, validation) in separate agents.
* **Clarity**: Your overall pipeline reads like a recipe—Agent A → Handoff → Agent B → Handoff → Agent C.
* **Maintainability**: Update or swap out a single sub-agent without touching the rest of the workflow.
* **Reusability**: Use the same sub-agents in different pipelines or contexts.
* **Testing**: Unit-test each agent in isolation, then test the handoff sequence to ensure smooth integration.



## **3. How Handoffs Work Under the Hood**

1. **Agent Execution**: The SDK runs the first agent with the full input (e.g. user prompt or accumulated history).
2. **Detection of Handoff**: When the agent’s instructions or your code insert a `Handoff(to="NextAgent")` in the chain, the SDK stops using the current agent.
3. **Context Transfer**: The conversation history—including user messages, tool outputs, and the first agent’s final output—becomes the input for the next agent.
4. **Next Agent Engagement**: The SDK instantiates (or retrieves) the named agent and runs it with that shared context, allowing it to continue seamlessly.



## **4. Benefits of Handoffs**

* **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent can focus on a single responsibility, making its prompt and logic simpler.
* **Scalability**: As requirements grow, you can insert new agents (e.g. a “QualityCheckAgent”) at specific handoff points.
* **Traceability**: With tracing enabled, you can see exactly when control passed from one agent to another and inspect intermediate outputs.
* **Performance Tuning**: Assign heavier LLM models only to the most critical steps, while lighter models handle routine tasks.



## **5. Best Practices**

1. **Descriptive Agent Names**: Make sure each agent’s `name` is unique and clearly indicates its role (“ExtractionAgent,” “SummarizerAgent,” etc.).
2. **Concise Instructions**: Give each agent a narrow, well-defined instruction set so it doesn’t drift outside its domain.
3. **Minimal Context**: Pass only the necessary slices of history or data to downstream agents to stay within token limits.
4. **Error Handling**: Anticipate failures—wrap handoffs in guardrails or fallback logic so a sub-agent error doesn’t break the entire pipeline.
5. **Tracing & Logging**: Keep tracing enabled during development to visualize handoff transitions; add logging to capture key data at each stage.



## **6. Common Use-Case Patterns**

* **Analysis → Summary**: Extract key points with one agent, then craft a coherent summary with the next.
* **Planning → Execution**: A “PlannerAgent” breaks a goal into tasks, then an “ExecutorAgent” carries them out (perhaps using function tools).
* **Validation → Reporting**: A “ValidatorAgent” checks data or user input against business rules, then a “ReporterAgent” generates a user-friendly report.
* **Translation → Localization**: A “TranslatorAgent” converts text into a base language, and a “LocalizerAgent” adapts tone and idioms for a specific region.



## **7. When Not to Use Handoffs**

* **Truly Simple Tasks**: If your workflow has only one step, a single agent is sufficient.
* **Highly Interdependent Logic**: When sub-tasks cannot be cleanly separated, embedding all logic in one agent may be simpler.
* **Low-Complexity Prototypes**: For quick experiments, handoffs add boilerplate—start simple, then refactor into handoffs as complexity grows.



By employing **handoffs**, you turn complex, multi-step requirements into elegant, maintainable pipelines of specialized agents. This pattern is key to scaling beyond one-off scripts into robust, production-grade agentic systems.
